 # About me
 
<p>  
 üë©üèª‚Äçüíª &emsp; As a Full Stack Developer I am working with a team as an Intern, where I learned and sharpen my skill and learned to adapt to different scenarios. I am eager to learn type and can handle a pressure to meet the deadline.

 üí° &emsp; My Passion to Full Stack Developer begin when I was just surfing through a website. I was eager to know ‚ÄúHow a person can design a site that can handle people and provide with the information of what they want‚Äù. I Started to learn about the web development process and I soon decided to take the path of a Full Stack Developer.

 üñ•Ô∏è &emsp; I started my path with a small steps with self-learning through books and videos. Then I started taking classes and then made through to be an Intern. I developed my skill as an front-end and back-end developer so that I can design a website that people can use.

 ‚è∞ &emsp; I am eagerly waiting to join a team where I can show case my skill and grow more along with the team, waiting to take on the challenges on the project. <br/><br/>
